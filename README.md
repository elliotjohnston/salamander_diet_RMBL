# salamander_diet_RMBL

This repository is in support of a project assessing predator (tiger salamander)-prey (fairy shrimp) dynamics in a subalpine freshwater wetland complex. 

Raw and processed data are in the Data folder

R scripts for producing figures that appear in the manuscript are in the Scripts folder

Figures are in the Outputs folder. In many cases, the images in this folder were made into the paper figures in Powerpoint. The bipartite plot was saved directly to a desktop rather than the Outputs folder. The code to produce this plot can be found in the Salamander_Diet.R script.
